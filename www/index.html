                <p>With no money and no connections, you can create more impact than anyone could have imagined 100
                    years ago. The inverse is also true. With lots of capital and connections, with all the money
                    and
                    endorsements and fame in the world, you can have less of an impact than anyone could have
                    imagined
                    100 years ago.</p>

                <p><strong>People don’t automatically trust brands anymore.</strong></p>

                <p>If you’re creating uninspiring ads, this is bad news. If you’re committed to creating an
                    interesting,
                    thoughtful small business brand that actually stands for something, it’s great news!</p>

                <p>Because it’s harder than ever to compete with Wal-Mart, it’s easier than ever to compete with
                    Wal-Mart. Make sense? You just need to accept that you’re not actually competing with
                    Wal-Mart.</p>

                <p>You’re building a category of one.</p>

                <p><em>A permanent monopoly with you as the only participant.</em></p>

                <button class="btn expand-post-btn d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center my-4 mx-auto" type="button"
                        data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsePost"

                    Read <span class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down mx-2"></span> More
                </button>

                <div class="collapse" id="collapsePost">
                    <p>It’s what Alison Werder did with the Ali J Boutique: she created a category of “classy women’s
                        clothing for fashionable ladies in their midlife who want to shop in an uplifting retail
                        environment
                        inspired by Proverbs 31.”</p>

                    <p>In a town of less than 2,000 (in a county with less than 30,000 people), that’s so absurdly
                        specific
                        it is a MONOPOLY.</p>

                    <p>Lucky for us, the feds don’t yet prosecute small town boutiques for violation of anti-trust laws.
                        Until they do, the best marketing strategy is the deliberate design of monopoly branding.</p>

                    <p>Something that is so unique that it doesn’t have any competition. Not just “minimal” competition.
                        ZERO competition.</p>

                    <p>None. Nada. Zip.</p>

                    <p><strong>This is your opportunity for 2019!</strong></p>

                    <p>It wasn’t always this way. Back when our grandparents were creating (and consuming)
                        advertisements,
                        your budget <em>could</em> build a brand. If you threw enough money into mass advertising, it
                        would
                        inevitably create sales.</p>

                    <p>This is no longer true.</p>

                    <p>Democratized distribution creates a marketing meritocracy. It’s realllllllllly easy to launch
                        Facebook ads and email campaigns. This is absolutely and unequivocally a good thing. It means
                        that
                        the quality of the marketing itself, not just the product, matters. It means that anyone can
                        launch
                        a brand. And precisely BECAUSE anyone can launch a brand, we are increasingly skeptical of new
                        ideas
                        and products and promotions.</p>

                    <p>In a connected world of social media and Netflix and push notifications and email and Slack and
                        retargeting cookies, our most valuable asset is still our attention.</p>

                    <p>That’s why the phrase “pay attention” exists.</p>

                    <p>Many business models don’t require a paid subscription to access content. We pay with our
                        attention
                        (which is then monetized and sold to advertisers). That’s how Vanderbilt monopolized the
                        steamship
                        industry in the 1800’s (free tickets subsidized by high margin concession sales). It’s why the
                        phrase “soap opera” exists (Procter & Gamble sponsored the entire production of popular radio
                        programs in the 1920’s to sell more soap). It’s how Larry & Sergey built Google and how
                        Zuckerberg
                        built Facebook. It’s the not-so-secret business model behind many billion dollar companies.
                        Because
                        it works.</p>

                    <p>But here’s the thing....</p>

                    <p>You can hack the system.</p>

                    <p>You don’t need to pay to rent if you already have equity. Just create something worth paying
                        attention to so you don’t have to spend so much money on advertising!</p>

                    <p>Cut out the middleman.</p>

                    <p>You don’t need capital. You need creativity. Our dynamic economy now offers fewer guarantees, but
                        even more opportunity.</p>

                    <p>This is bad news for Goliath but great news for David.</p>

                    <p><strong>2019 will be the best year ever for small business marketing....</strong> for those
                        humble enough to accept
                        their role as the underdog. People love a good underdog story!</p>

                    <p>Grab a stone and a sling this year. Leave the sword behind.</p>
